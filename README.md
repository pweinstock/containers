# containers
This project is about re-implementing some of the C++ standard template library containers.

All the C++98 features of the containers had to be implemented. Usage of C++98 was mandatory.

## Implemented containers
- vector
- map
- stack
- set (with a binary search tree as underlying data structure)

## Also implemented
- std::iterator_traits
- std::reverse_iterator
- std::enable_if (in a C++98 manner)
- std::is_integral
- std::equal
- std::lexicographical_compare
- std::pair
- std::make_pair
